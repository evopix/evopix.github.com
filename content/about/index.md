I've been a Software Engineer for {{< years "2005-09-01" >}} years now. I spent the first 6 years of my career as a Full Stack Engineer but transitioned to Backend full-time {{< years "2012-03-01" >}} years ago.

I've worked on everything from e-commerce, data platforms, AdTech, and most recently FinTech. I primarily specialize in API developoment but I also have lots of experience in DevOps. I'm very passionate about improving developer experiences and workflows.
